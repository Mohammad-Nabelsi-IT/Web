            Mobile first, responsive design is the goal. Bootstrap’s CSS aims
            to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the
            smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design
            for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering
            time,
            and provides a great experience for your visitors.
